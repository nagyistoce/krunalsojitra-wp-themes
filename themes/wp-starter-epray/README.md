##WP-Starter by DMSQD

A good starting point for our WordPress projects, developed from Bones.

Fully responsive.

Note scripts.js compiles to scripts.min.js!

I strongly suggest using the SCSS files, especially in the responsive version as the legacy IE stylesheet is compiled automatically without the media queries. If you don't want to, strip the IE stylesheet include out yourself and use a media query polyfill.

Now uses [CSS Wizardry Grids](https://github.com/csswizardry/csswizardry-grids).
